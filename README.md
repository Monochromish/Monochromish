   I spend most of my time contributing to open-source projects. While many of my current projects are private, I do have one open-source project that I'm particularly proud of: [Kalopsia-Bot](https://github.com/Monochromish/Kalopsia-Bot).

Kalopsia-Bot is a powerful Discord bot written in JavaScript that comes packed with a wide range of moderation, fun, economy, music, and utility commands. Consider starring the repository and checking it out for yourself.
