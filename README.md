### Hey hey, I'm Himanshu! ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate and part-time developer who is passionate about exploring new technologies. Over the past few years, I have worked on various projects using different languages and frameworks. Some of my proudest work has been with [Cider Collective LLC](https://github.com/ciderapp).

I enjoy diving into new stacks, often building something to better understand its workings (and sometimes forgetting it later). This GitHub profile of mine showcases a mix of experiments, learnings, and projects I'm genuinely proud of. Interested in collaborating? Or want to say hi? Feel free to reach me through my [website](https://himanshu.sh).
